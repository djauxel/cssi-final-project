# Welcome to San Diego - CSSI Final Project
This is my group's final project for the 2018 CSSI Extension program at CSUSM. We had a timeframe of one week to develop a web application using Google App Engine. Link to our project website can be found here. (https://yelp-dot-first-torus-213617.appspot.com/)

# Idea behind 'Welcome to San Diego'
This service was created for the purpose of helping fellow San Diego residents and visitors to the area to be able to explore a wide variety of events going on in the area as well as the array of dining options available. Whether you are looking to take a hike on some of San Diego's most popular trails or trying to find that perfect dining spot, we've got you covered. With a true accurate temperature reading, you will be informed in real time about the temperature in San Diego so that you will always be prepared before you take that trip to visit different spots in the area. Our mission is to provide our customers with the best experience possible which is why we are frequently working to improve and make updates to this website. We hope that you enjoy using our website and all the services it has to offer.
